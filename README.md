This is task 3 of ENCRYPTIX | Data Science Domain.

Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues,and split the dataset into training and testing sets.Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, toclassify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.

Thrilled to share my latest project where I used logistic regression to tackle credit card fraud detection. This hands-on experience with data balancing and model training has significantly sharpened my skills in handling imbalanced datasets and implementing effective fraud detection techniques

Project Highlights:

‚Ä¢ Loaded and explored the credit card fraud dataset.
‚Ä¢ Analyzed the imbalance in transaction classes.
‚Ä¢ Balanced the dataset using undersampling techniques.
‚Ä¢ Trained a Logistic Regression model.
‚Ä¢ Achieved high accuracy in detecting fraudulent transactions.

Steps Involved:

‚Ä¢ Imported essential libraries for data manipulation and modeling.
‚Ä¢ Loaded and explored the credit card fraud dataset.
‚Ä¢ Analyzed and identified the imbalance in transaction classes.
‚Ä¢ Separated legitimate and fraudulent transactions for further analysis.
‚Ä¢ Performed statistical analysis to understand transaction patterns.
‚Ä¢ Balanced the dataset using undersampling techniques.
‚Ä¢ Split the data into training and testing sets.
‚Ä¢ Trained a Logistic Regression model on the training data.
‚Ä¢ Evaluated the model's accuracy on both training and test data.

Key Takeaway:

Developed a Logistic Regression model to effectively detect fraudulent credit card transactions, achieving high accuracy by addressing class imbalance through undersampling.
